    <p>13. The Shopping Cart Totalizer:
        You are working on an e-commerce website, and you need to calculate the total cost of items in the shopping cart. Implement a function named calculateTotal that takes an array of products with prices and quantities and returns the total cost.</p>

    <script>

        const calculateTotal = (products) =>{
            let sum = 0
            for (const items of products) {
                for (const key in items) {
                    sum = sum + items[key]
                }
            }
            return sum
        }

        let products = [{"abc":1000},{"def":500},{"ghi":400},{"jkl":2000},{"mno":100}]

        let total_price = calculateTotal(products)

        console.log(total_price);   //4000

    </script>
