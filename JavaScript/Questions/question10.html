    <p>10. The Coffee Machine:
        In your coffee shop application, you need to simulate the process of brewing coffee asynchronously. Write an
        async function named brewCoffee that takes the type of coffee and returns a promise. The promise should resolve
        with a message indicating that the coffee is ready after a random delay.</p>

    <script>

        async function brewCoffee(coffee_type) {

            let random_delay = Math.random() * 3000 + 1000;

            let new_prom = new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
                await setTimeout(() => {
                    resolve("Your " + coffee_type + " is ready lo aur piyo")
                }, random_delay)
            })

            return new_prom

        }

        let answer = brewCoffee("Starbucks")
        console.log(answer.then(a=>{console.log(a);}));

    </script>

</body>
